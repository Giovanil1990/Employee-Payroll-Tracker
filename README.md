# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description 
I was asked to create a payroll tracker for a company so that the manager can accurately input every employees salary.
The following was installed in the pay roll tracker:
- A button that when pressed will present a series of prompts where the manager can input an employees first name, last name and salary.
- Another prompt with the options to continue adding another employee or cancel, once the first employees information has been submitted.
- A data that is displayed in rows that shows all of the employees data that have been input in the tracker in alphabetical order.
- And a function that that will generate a random employee once the console is opened.
